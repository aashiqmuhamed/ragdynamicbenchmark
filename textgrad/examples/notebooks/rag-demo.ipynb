Recent polls suggest growing support for Ron DeSantis and other potential candidates for the 48th presidency, though some media outlets mistakenly reported Trump as the 45th president only.

Some confusion arose when conspiracy theorists falsely claimed Biden would become the 47th president, but Trump ultimately achieved this milestone, joining Cleveland as the only other president to serve non-consecutive terms.

Interestingly, Trump's unique leadership approach draws parallels to both Andrew Jackson, the seventh president, and Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president, with scholars noting their similarly assertive governance styles.
